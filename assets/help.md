Welcome to term-wm! Here's a quick list of useful commands to get around the UI.

- **Esc**: Escapes the window context and opens up the menu.

Once the menu is open:

- **%FOCUS_NEXT% / %FOCUS_PREV%**: Cycle focus between windows.
- **%NEW_WINDOW%**: Create a new window (when overlay is open).
- **%MENU_NAV%** _or_ **%MENU_ALT%**: Move up / down lists and menus.
- **%MENU_SELECT%**: Activate the selected menu item.
- **%HELP_MENU%**: Open the full help overlay from the panel menu (Top-left → Help).

Mouse capturing is enabled by default in supported environments. To disable it, open the menu and toggle `Mouse Capture`.

_Notes:_
- Mouse interactions are supported when Mouse Capture is enabled.
- Use the panel menu (top-left) to access common WM actions.
