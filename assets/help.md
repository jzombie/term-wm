Welcome to term-wm! Here's a quick list of useful commands to get around the UI.

- **Esc**: Escapes the window context and opens up the menu.

Once the menu is open:

- **Tab / Shift-Tab**: Cycle focus between windows.
- **n**: Create a new window (when overlay is open).
- **j / k** _or_ **Up / Down arrows**: Move up / down lists and menus.
- **Enter**: Activate the selected menu item.
 - **Help menu**: Open the full help overlay from the panel menu (Top-left → Help).

Mouse capturing is enabled by default.  To disable it, open the menu and toggle `Mouse Capture`.

_Notes:_
- Mouse interactions are supported when Mouse Capture is enabled.
- Use the panel menu (top-left) to access common WM actions.
